# Lyna - BETA

Lyna is a discord bot made to create license keys which grant the user a discord role.

This bot is not a licensing system in terms of application access, but in terms of support access.
Currently, license keys needs to be created by hand and send to the user manually.
Roles are sticky and will be assigned to the user when he joins again.

Access to a license can also be shared with other users to give them access to support channels as well.

Licenses can be transferred to another discord account.

Additionally, Lyna allows to share artifacts served by a sonatype nexus.
She can also serve artifacts from repositories which require authentication.
Access to artifacts is either controlled by an existing license or by a role assigned to the user.
You can differentiate between different build types.
This allows you to make dev builds only available for specific licenses or roles for example.

_Trivia: Lyna is the captain of the defensive guard at Crystarium in the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy 
XIV, which includes a free trial that includes the entirety of "A Realm Reborn" AND the award-winning "Heavensward" 
expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions on playtime._

*The bot is functional, but considered beta. Not everything can be changed via commands yet.*
